# tank-remote

This example code connects to the first hub it finds and then starts up
a console UI so that it can read keyboard inputs. Connect it to a robot
with tank-style steering on motors C and D and drive it around with the
arrow keys! When you're done, press `q` to disconnect and quit.

## Usage
```bash
cargo run --package tank-remote
